## Design Philosophy

This app embraces the **skeuomorphic card metaphor** - notes feel like physical cards you can touch and interact with. The design is clean yet tactile, with subtle shadows and a fade mask that mimics how text disappears at the edge of physical paper.

**Key Design Decisions**:
- **Mobile-First**: Cards are optimized for phone screens with full-height display
- **Vertical Stack**: Natural scrolling metaphor like flipping through a deck of cards
- **No Scrollbars**: Clean card aesthetic maintained with fade mask for overflow
- **Typography**: Carefully chosen font sizes and spacing for mobile readability
- **Performance**: Lightweight implementation without heavy animation libraries

## Development Approach

- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Features developed with tests written first
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Modular, reusable React components
- **TypeScript First**: Strong typing for better developer experience
- **Performance Conscious**: Minimal dependencies and optimized rendering
