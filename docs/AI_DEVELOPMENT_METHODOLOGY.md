## Core Methodology: The Collaborative Development Cycle

### 1. **Permission-Based Development Control**
The foundation of effective AI collaboration is explicit permission management:

```
Permission States:
- "+x" (Execute): AI can write code and make changes
- "-x" (Discuss): AI provides analysis, asks clarifying questions, plans approaches
```

**Why This Works:**
- Prevents unwanted code changes during planning phases
- Enables thorough requirement gathering before implementation
- Creates clear boundaries between discussion and execution

### 2. **Meeting-Driven Requirements Gathering**
Treat AI collaboration like a professional development meeting:

```markdown
Example Question Pattern:
1. What specific features are you looking to create?
2. What existing features would you like to change?
3. What's your priority order for these changes?
4. Are there any technical constraints or preferences?
5. What's your timeline expectation?
```

**Benefits:**
- Comprehensive understanding before coding begins
- Documented decision-making process
- Reduced back-and-forth during implementation

### 3. **Documentation-First Approach**
Maintain living documentation throughout the development process:

- **Meeting Notes**: Capture requirements, decisions, and technical discussions
- **Status Updates**: Track progress, completed features, and next steps
- **Architecture Decisions**: Document technical choices and rationales

---

## Communication Patterns That Work

### **Effective Request Formats**

#### For Requirements Gathering:
```
"1 I want to make the cards have three types of heights
2 styling I think? like I've said in 1  
3 make the three types of height first
4 improve the information density
5 maintain current architecture, but tell me what is the best solution"
```

#### For Technical Implementation:
```
"+x implement the golden spiral height system"
```

#### For Discussion and Planning:
```
"-x I want to create some feature and change some feature, 
let's start with discussion like a meeting"
```

### **AI Response Patterns**

#### During Discussion Mode (-x):
- Ask 5-7 targeted clarifying questions
- Provide multiple technical approaches with trade-offs
- Create comprehensive meeting notes
- Offer recommendations with rationale

#### During Implementation Mode (+x):
- Focus on code execution
- Update documentation automatically
- Run tests to validate changes
- Provide progress summaries

## Technical Implementation Strategy

### **1. Iterative Development with Validation**
```
Plan → Implement → Test → Document → Iterate
```

**Example from Card Rail:**
1. **Plan**: Golden spiral height system with 4 height variants
2. **Implement**: Content measurement utility + dynamic CSS classes
3. **Test**: Update test suite, verify build success
4. **Document**: Update README, status, and meeting notes
5. **Iterate**: Refine based on validation results

### **2. Architecture-Preserving Changes**
Always respect the existing codebase structure:
- Maintain current dependencies when possible
- Preserve existing test coverage
- Keep bundle size optimized
- Follow established code patterns

### **3. Comprehensive Testing Strategy**
```typescript
Testing Approach:
- Run tests after major changes
- Update test expectations when functionality changes
- Maintain 100% test coverage
- Use TypeScript for compile-time validation
```

## Tools and Techniques

### **Development Tools Integration**
```bash
# Build validation
pnpm build

# Test coverage maintenance  
pnpm test

# Real-time preview
pnpm dev

# Package management
pnpm install    # Install dependencies
pnpm add <pkg>  # Add new package
```

### **Documentation Tools**
- **Meeting Notes**: Capture real-time decisions and requirements
- **Status Tracking**: Monitor progress and technical metrics
- **Architecture Documentation**: Record technical decisions

### **Quality Assurance**
- **TypeScript**: Compile-time error prevention
- **ESLint**: Code quality enforcement
- **Vitest**: Comprehensive test coverage
- **Next.js**: Production-ready framework patterns

---

## Key Success Factors

### **1. Clear Communication Boundaries**
- Use explicit permission states (+x/-x)
- Structure requirements in numbered lists
- Separate planning from implementation phases

### **2. Systematic Problem Solving**
- Break complex features into smaller components
- Validate each step before proceeding
- Maintain documentation throughout the process

### **3. Quality-First Approach**
- Preserve test coverage during refactoring
- Maintain performance metrics (bundle size, build time)
- Follow established architectural patterns

### **4. Iterative Refinement**
- Start with basic implementations
- Gather feedback through testing and validation
- Refine based on actual usage patterns

## Case Study: Card Rail Development

### **Challenge**: Dynamic Card Heights with Golden Spiral Proportions
**Requirement**: Cards should auto-size based on content using golden ratio mathematics

### **Methodology Applied**:

1. **Requirements Gathering (-x mode)**:
   - Clarified 4 height variants (small, medium, large, full)
   - Confirmed content measurement approach over word counting
   - Established UI changes (remove scroll dots, no card scrolling)

2. **Technical Planning**:
   - Evaluated 3 implementation approaches
   - Chose content measurement for accuracy
   - Planned golden spiral mathematics (φ³, φ², φ, 1)

3. **Implementation (+x mode)**:
   - Created `cardHeight.ts` utility for measurement
   - Updated Card component with dynamic heights
   - Removed scroll indicators and related code

4. **Validation**:
   - Updated test suite for new expectations
   - Verified build success (148kB bundle maintained)
   - Tested in browser with development server

5. **Documentation**:
   - Updated README with new features
   - Recorded technical decisions in meeting notes
   - Maintained status tracking

**Result**: Successfully implemented golden spiral height system with zero regressions

## Best Practices for AI Collaboration

### **Do's**
✅ Use explicit permission states to control development phases  
✅ Document requirements thoroughly before implementation  
✅ Validate changes through testing and building  
✅ Maintain clear communication with numbered lists  
✅ Preserve existing architecture and patterns  
✅ Update documentation alongside code changes  

### **Don'ts**
❌ Skip the planning phase and jump directly to coding  
❌ Make changes without understanding the full requirements  
❌ Break existing functionality without updating tests  
❌ Ignore compilation errors or test failures  
❌ Change architectural patterns without discussion  
❌ Leave documentation outdated after code changes
